# Firewall with iptables
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple yet powerful firewall using `iptables` on Ubuntu. The firewall leverages the flexibility of the Netfilter framework to secure Linux-based systems by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on customized rules.

## Key Features
- **Packet Filtering**: Inspects and processes packets according to rules defined for source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, and connection states.
- **Essential Access Control**: Allows critical services like SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) while blocking unauthorized traffic by default.
- **Granular Traffic Management**: Permits traffic from trusted IPs and restricts unnecessary access.
- **Persistence Across Reboots**: Saves configured rules using `iptables-persistent`.
- **Real-World Application**: Mimics scenarios such as mitigating ransomware attacks by blocking vulnerable ports.

## Implementation Highlights
1. Installed and configured `iptables` to define rules for traffic management.
2. Enabled default policies to block all incoming traffic unless explicitly allowed.
3. Tested and validated rules to ensure functionality and security in diverse scenarios.

## Recommendations
To enhance future implementations:
- Integrate with monitoring tools for real-time threat detection.
- Automate rule management with tools like Ansible.
- Incorporate advanced logging mechanisms for better analytics.
- Optimize performance for high-traffic systems or migrate to scalable solutions like `nftables`.

This project underscores the importance of precise and adaptable network security measures, demonstrating how even fundamental tools like `iptables` can create robust defenses against modern cybersecurity threats.
